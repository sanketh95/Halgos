# Graph Algorithms

The graph algorithms I'm hoping cover in this are

* DFS (Depth First Search)
* BFS (Breadth First Search)
* Topological Sort
* Minimum Spanning Tree
    * Kruskall's Algorithm
    * Prim's Algorithm
* Shortest Path
    * Djikstra's Algorithm
    * Bellman Ford Algorithm
* Maximum Flow
